            In the HNG internship, my goal is to grow as a developer who codes with both logic and intention. 
            I want to refine my frontend skills, learn from real-world collaboration, and turn ideas into projects that genuinely solve problems.
            This internship is a chance for me to bridge my studies in Mathematics and Computer Science with hands-on experience â€” to build, to learn, and to push my limits one line of code at a time.
